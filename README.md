# IntroductionToMachineLearning
Lab exercises from MIT course on introduction to Machine Learning.
I have only started to learn about Machine Learning algorithms. Throughout this course there lab excercises available without solutions.
I will post my solutions here in addition to brief description of main concepts that I've learned.
