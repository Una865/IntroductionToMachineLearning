# IntroductionToMachineLearning
I've started learning Machine Learning on my own and while searching for materials online I found out about this MIT course that I find very thoroguh and helpful. 
The Aim of this repository is to put all my notes and codes that I've wrote into one place that will be easy to come back to and remember things that I've done. Also, it may be helpful to someone else that is also new to this field.

Throughout this course there are lab excercises and homeworks that can be done in many ways. I will post some of my solutions, but also I will post codes that I wrote with their helper function which I will indicate in the code. Also I believe that when I am writing my notes in this way I see more clearly what is it that I understand and what is it that I have some problems with.  

I also hope to come back some day when I become more advanced to have a look back on my progress at the beginning and where it led me to.

I hope tha my future self would be proud on the fact that I was consistent with learning this very growing field.

NOTE: There are not only homeworks in the folders. When learning new algorithm I like to play with different data types, therefore I sometimes try project not included in the course which I will also post here :)
