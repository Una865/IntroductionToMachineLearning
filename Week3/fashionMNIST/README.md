## Fashion MNIST data

Experimenting with distinguishing clothes.

I used fashion MNIST data, 900 data samples were used for training and 100 for evaluating accuracy. The goal of the linear classifier is to learn to distinguish between two different types of clothes. Clothes are labeled from 0 to 9:

- 0	T-shirt/top
- 1	Trouser
- 2	Pullover
- 3	Dress
- 4	Coat
- 5	Sandal
- 6	Shirt
- 7	Sneaker
- 8	Bag
- 9	Ankle boots

With **raw_mnist_features** feature extraction I achieved great accuracies.
