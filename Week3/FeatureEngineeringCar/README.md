# Defining features for data

When dealing with features it is important to be aware of what kind of data we are dealing with. When looking at numbers, the data is usually divided into discrete and continious, but what is their difference?

## Discrete Data
Discrete values can be reffered to as "the number of". They take specific countable values. Examples of discrete data are:
- number of people in the classroom 
- number of push-ups done
- number of presents

## Continous Data
It is any measured value within a specific range. Examples of continious data are:
- the temperature of a room
- the car speed
- the height of children
