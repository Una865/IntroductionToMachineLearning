Autoencoders

This projects is my aim to experiment with different kinds of autoencoders and their architecture. I would like to build accurate model and then use it as a feature extractor for CIFAR10 cllassification problem. 

1. CNNae1.py - accuracy was around 80% and the architecture can be seen in the script
2. CNNae2.py - accuracy was 83% which is slightly better then previous autoencoder with similar architecture, but this one was more shallow
3. CNN ae3.py :
