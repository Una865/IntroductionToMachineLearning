## neural networks part two

this was the sion of the last week. In the lectures the discussion was about regulazires and optimization algorithms. For the purpose of excercising, I was using neural network to predict diabetes. I used 2 hidden layers and relu activation function for it. For the output layer I used softmax activation function as interpretation of the probability of the data sample belonging to the class.
