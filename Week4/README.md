## Linear logistic classifier

New hypothesis class was introduced: linear logistic classifier. Insted of output values only being {-1,+1} with logistic function we now have output ranging from 0 to 1 (zero and 1 are not included because it is not possible to get exactly 1). This is done uby using sigmoid function or logistic function.
